# Dynamic Pricing and Inventory Management: End-to-End Price & Inventory Optimization

This project applies data science and operations research techniques to optimize **product pricing** and **inventory management** using real-world datasets. The goal is to simulate the decision-making pipeline for a retail business — from setting prices to managing stock — while maximizing revenue and minimizing cost.

## Business Context

Retailers face the challenge of setting competitive prices while ensuring sufficient stock availability. Poor pricing can reduce revenue, and bad inventory planning can lead to lost sales or excess holding costs. This project tackles these core challenges using:
- Price elasticity modeling
- Time-series demand forecasting
- ABC-XYZ inventory classification
- Inventory policy simulation

---

## Key Features

- **Price Optimization**  
  Estimate price elasticity and simulate revenue-maximizing price points.

- **Demand Forecasting**  
  Forecast future demand using SARIMA and Prophet models.

- **Inventory Optimization**  
  Recommend inventory levels using EOQ, safety stock models, and SKU segmentation.

- **Inventory Classification**  
  Segment SKUs by value (ABC) and predictability (XYZ) for differentiated policies.
